TODO  LIST:
	Ensure different XML files will behave in same manner
		Note: If all xml's have the same element id there should be no issue populating any given inspection form tempalte
	Populate the fields in the next block of items
	Loop program back to showdialog box if a non xml file is selected
	Code to iterate throug
	Will have to map out each page and the XML values it wants
	
	Bugs:
	(RESOLVED)does not work with a second xml, exception errors suggest the second inspection xml has a different starting index
		Notes: This error I originally got when I started with the first XML, this was resolved using a starting index of 0
		however I do not yet fully understand the context of why this works.
		I need to find a way to iterate through an entire XML lines and ignore ones where errors such as "An errro occured while parsing EntityName.Line n, position n" are thrown
		
	Does not like ampersand character(&), throws an error
		will need to see if I can replace any instances of the ampersand symbol with a string literal
